# Integrate path-planning algorithms with PDDL planners

## Objectives

* Understand the importance of path-planning in robotics.
* Study and implement well-known path planning algorithms.
* Compare the algorithms using different heuristics.
* Integrate PDDL planners with path planning algorihtms.


## Introduction

The pseudocode that will be used in this practical assignment is taken from the article [Theta*: Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3843.pdf) published in the Journal of AI Research, 39: 533-579 (2010). 

 The algorithms will be implemented in Python, and there will be two different practical assignments depending on the lab group. Upload to the platform ONLY the practical assignments corresponding to your lab group. The number of members in each group can be up to 5. Uploading a different one will be considered as not **performed** and then, it will not be taken into account into the lab mark. It is compulsatory to use Git and make ```Commits/``` betweens the members of the group.

The practical assignment is inspired in the article published by Pablo Muñoz, María D. R-Moreno and David F. Barrero. [Unified framework for path-planning and task-planning for autonomous robots](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889016302184?via%3Dihub). Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Vol. 82, pp:1-14 August 2016.
